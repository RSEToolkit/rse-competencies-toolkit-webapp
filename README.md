# RSE Competencies Toolkit

A Django webapp for hosting the RSE Competencies Toolkit.

This Django project uses:

- [`pip-tools`] for packaging and dependency management.
- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) for various linting, formatting and static type checking. Pre-commit hooks are automatically kept updated with [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci).
- [`pytest`](https://pytest.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

[`pip-tools`] is chosen as a lightweight dependency manager that adheres to the [latest standards](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) using `pyproject.toml`.

## Installation

To get started:

1. Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate # with Powershell on Windows: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
   ```

2. Install development requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optionally) install tools for building documentation:

   ```bash
   pip install -r doc-requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install the git hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. Run the webapp:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   When running the webapp for the first time you may get a warning similar to:

   `You have 19 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, main, sessions.`

   If this is the case, stop your webapp (with CONTROL-C) and apply the migrations with:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

   then restart it.

6. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

7. Create an admin account to access admin backend:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

### Installation with Docker

The app can be run within a Docker container and a `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to make this easy for development.

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installed and simply run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

The app will be available at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

## Updating Dependencies

To add or remove dependencies:

1. Edit the `dependencies` variables in the `pyproject.toml` file (aim to keep development tools separate from the project requirements).
2. Update the requirements files:
   - `pip-compile` for `requirements.txt` - the project requirements.
   - `pip-compile --extra dev -o dev-requirements.txt` for the development requirements.
   - `pip-compile --extra doc -o doc-requirements.txt` for the documentation tools.
3. Sync the files with your installation (install packages):
   - `pip-sync *requirements.txt`

To upgrade pinned versions, use the `--upgrade` flag with `pip-compile`.

Versions can be restricted from updating within the `pyproject.toml` using standard python package version specifiers, i.e. `"black<23"` or `"pip-tools!=6.12.2"`
